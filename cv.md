##About m—Éself
I am a simple guy from a city in the south of Russia, Rostov on Don. I study and work just like normal people. I came to study at the rolling scopes because I want to become a frontend developer.

I tried many programming languages at the university, but decided that the frontend is still closer to me than any other area of development. I hope I will be able to finish this course and go further, I just need to have patience and a little discipline and everything will work out for sure.
